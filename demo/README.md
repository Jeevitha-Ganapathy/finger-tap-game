# Finger Tap Game 

A fast-paced, competitive 2-player finger tap game built using Flutter. Each player taps on their screen area to gain control — the first to expand their area fully wins!

##  How It Works
- Two players tap simultaneously (Player A and Player B)
- Tapping increases your color region and score
- Once a player dominates the screen, the game ends
- Displays a winner screen with score and restart option
